# Project Assignment 5: The Calculator

Create a calculator that has buttons corresponding to 0â€”9, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and a equals sign button. Ideally, you would find a cool calculator app on your mobile phone and try to replicate the design; you can skip any 3d shadows and complex gradients.

Include a button with the text DEL, and another with CLEAR. Use a text input to represent a calculator screen, where the buttons that user inputs will be mirrored.

Focus on styling your calculator to be alluring using hover states and any other styles that improve the experience. You will address its functionality in the next chapter.
